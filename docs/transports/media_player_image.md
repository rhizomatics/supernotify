# Media Image Transport Adaptor

Show an image on a media player, e.g. an Alexa Show ( where that actually works, depending on model ). It uses the
`alexapy` integration, which calls an unofficial `/api/background-image` API on the Echo device.

The image must be on an `https` URL with valid certificate.
