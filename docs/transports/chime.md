# Chime Transport Adaptor

| Transport ID         | Source      | Requirements | Optional |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------- |
| `chime` | :material-github:[`chime.py`](https://github.com/rhizomatics/supernotify/blob/main/custom_components/supernotify/transports/chime.py) | - | :material-home-assistant: [Alexa Devices Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alexa_devices/),:simple-homeassistantcommunitystore: [Alexa Media Player Integration](https://github.com/alandtse/alexa_media_player),:material-home-assistant: [RFLink](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rflink/),:material-home-assistant: [MQTT Siren](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/siren.mqtt/) etc. |


Notify using a sound of your choosing - for example a doorbell, barking dog, siren or recording.
This works with a variety of devices, from cheap 433Mhz doorbell units to Amazon Echo devices.

You can mix and match any of these devices in a single notification call, and combine them
with mobile_push, e-mail etc.

The range of tunes from modern devices gives a good alternative to being bothered with lots
of push notifications. For example, if a PIR detects motion and the alarm panel is disarmed
you could have a *ping* sound from Amazon Echos and chime devices.


## Aliases

While you can construct an action call with a list of switches, device_ids, scripts etc and the names
of tunes for them, it is much easier to configure this in one place using the alias definition.

So rather than remembering that the doorbell sound you like is called `amzn_sfx_doorbell_chime_02`
on Alexa, you can simply pass `chime_tune: doorbell` on each of your automations. This also means
if you get bored with that doorbell sound, you can quickly change it one place for all automations that use it.

A doorbell notification can be sent to multiple devices just by selecting a tune ( see the
[Example Configuration](#example) below for how this can work.)

```yaml
    - action: notify.supernotify
      data:
        message: ""
        delivery:
            chimes:
                data:
                    chime_tune: doorbell
```

Another good reason is that when using multiple types of device, you can map their different
terms to the same logical sound using simple alias names, for example `doorbell`. Then within notifications, you
can ask for a doorbell sound and it will generated by each device in its own way.

In this example, a 433Mhz doorbell will go 'ding dong' and Alexa will play a doorbell noise when the
`chime_tune: doorbell` is set on a notification, and if `red_alert` is set, it will use Alexa and a siren
device.

```yaml title="Config Snippet"
 chime_aliases:
    doorbell:
      alexa_devices:
        tune: amzn_sfx_doorbell_chime_02
      switch:
        target: switch.chime_ding_dong
    red_alert:
      alexa_devices: amzn_sfx_scifi_alarm_04
      siren:
        tune: emergency
```

For *Alexa Devices*, there's an additional benefit of using the aliases - it will automatically select
all the Alexa device IDs ( those ugly 32 character hexadecimal ones ) if device discovery is left on, as is
default. For everything else, you need to pass the list of target entity IDs in the notification action call.

The formal schema is published as [Chime Aliases Definition](../developer/schemas/Chime_Aliases_Definition.md).
Validation of the config happens at start up by the chime transport, with errors sent to log with usually
an explanation of which part of the config triggered the problem.

## Device Types

### Switch and Siren

Provide a list of `switch`, `siren` entities to use for chimes
and it will call the `switch.turn_on` or `siren.turn_on` calls as appropriate.

Switches are simple binary affairs, however some sirens can also have a choice of tones, volume
level and durations. The following generic chime tunings are passed to the siren.

| Chime Option   | Siren Data Field |
|----------------|------------------|
| chime_tune     | tone             |
| chime_volume   | volume           |
| chime_duration | duration         |


Supernotify passes on the `data` structure exactly as it is on the regular Home Assistant actions,
see the documentation for those integrations below:

- [Siren](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/siren/)
- [Switch](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/switch/)


Switches are a little special, in that though they are binary on/off in Home Assistant, in
practice even some of the cheap 433Mhz ones can take an additional melody code, its common to
have different melodies represented by separate `switch` entities for the same underlying devices
as in this example Byron device using the [RFLink](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rflink/) integration.

```yaml
- platform: rflink
  devices:
    byron_0000_01:
      name: Chime Tubular
    byron_0000_02:
      name: Chime Morning Dew
    byron_0000_03:
      name: Chime Big Ben
```
### Scripts

Provide one or more `script` entity IDs, for example, `script.call_bell_api`.

Each script will be called with:

- `message` - from the notification
- `title`   - optional on the notification
- `chime_tune` - name of the chime if supplied
- `chime_duration` - where passed in action data or defined in chime alias
- `chime_volume` - where passed in action data or defined in chime alias

Additional variables can be configured when defining an alias using the `variables` attribute in `data`.

See also [Script](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/script/) in HomeAssistant documentation.

### Alexa Media Player

NOTE: Requires the [`Alexa Media Player`](https://github.com/alandtse/alexa_media_player) integration
to be installed on Home Assistant.

Supply `media_player` entities as targets and this transport will make appropriate `media_player.play_media`
action calls to them, passing the sound name provided in `tune` field.

See https://github.com/alandtse/alexa_media_player/wiki#known-available-sounds for
a list of known tunes that work with Alexa devices.

### Alexa Devices

This supports the newer built-in [Alexa Devices](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alexa_devices/)
integration introduced in 2025.

The list of sounds can be found on the [Alexa API](https://alexa.amazon.com/api/behaviors/entities?skillId=amzn1.ask.1p.sound), after authenticating, or on the [Home Assistant source code](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/alexa_devices/strings.json#L105). It includes a generous helping of Halloween specific sounds.

One oddity of this integration is that although it generates traditional entity IDs for notifying Alexa devices,
sending a sound ( or command ) requires a long and obscure `device_id` (a 32 character random hexadecimal pseudo-UUID)While you can find these from the *Devices* section of the *Alexa Devices* integration config, or using the *Action*
feature of *Developer Tools* and switching to yaml mode, the easiest way is to **automatically register** all Alexa devices by using `device_discovery: True` on the transport configuration, and using the alias definition feature.

Sometimes you may end up with odd devices like headphones or firesticks that Alexa knows about but don't make sense for HomeAssistant usage, and also may have duplication if a group has been created inside the Alexa app ( which then appears to Home Assistant as another Alexa device even though its really a group of them. The weird devices can be disabled from the *Alexa Devices* integration config. Within Supernotify, you can use `device_model_include` and `device_model_exclude` to control the list - both of these take a single value, or list of values, plain strings or regular expressions. Chime transport has a default exclusion for
Alexa Groups, specifying either an include or exclude list will switch off defaulting for both values.

## Example

```yaml
transports:
  chime:
    device_discovery: True
    device_model_include: Speaker Group
    target:
      - media_player.kitchen_echo
      - media_player.bedroom
      - ffff0000eeee1111dddd2222cccc3333 # Alexa Devices device_id
    options:
        chime_aliases:
              doorbell: #alias
                alexa_devices: # integration domain or label ( if label then domain must be a key in the config )
                    tune: amzn_sfx_cat_meow_1x_01
                media_player:
                    # resolves to media_player/play_media with sound configured for this path
                    tune: home/amzn_sfx_doorbell_chime_02
                    # entity_id list defaults to `target` of transport default or action call
                    # this entry can also be shortcut as `media_player: home/amzn_sfx_doorbell_chime_02`
                media_player_alt:
                    # Not all the media players are Amazon Alexa based, so override for other flavours
                    tune: raindrops_and_roses.mp4
                    target:
                        - media_player.hall_custom
                switch:
                    # resolves to switch/turn_on with entity id switch.ding_dong
                    target: switch.chime_ding_dong
                siren_except_bedroom:
                    # resolves to siren/turn_on with tune bleep and default volume/duration
                    tune: bleep
                    domain: siren # domain must be explicit since key is label not domain and no explicit targets
                siren_bedroom:
                    # short and quiet burst for just the bedroom siren
                    domain: siren
                    tune: bleep
                    target: siren.bedroom
                    volume: 0.1
                    duration: 5
                script:
                    target: script.pull_bell_cord
                    data:
                      variables:
                        duration: 25

              red_alert:
                # non-dict defaults to a dict with a single key `tune`
                alexa_devices: scifi/amzn_sfx_scifi_alarm_04
                siren: emergency
```

## Rest Commands

Assuming this command is set up in the Home Assistant configuration:

```yaml title="CCTV Camera Siren"
rest_commands:
  camera_siren:
      url: "http://10.111.10.202/ISAPI/Event/triggers/notifications/AudioAlarm/{{hik_alarm_code|default('11')}}/test?format=json"
      method: put
      username: !secret hik_user
      password: !secret hik_password
      authentication: digest
```

This chime alias in the transport definition will make it available as `chime_tune: siren` in notifications.

```yaml title="Supernotify Config Snippet"
```yaml
transports:
  chime:
    options:
        chime_aliases:
          siren:
            rest_command:
                target: rest_command.camera_siren
                data:
                  alarm_code: 11

```

The same tune could also define MQTT sirens, or Amazon Echo devices making siren noises, so one call with
`chime_tune: siren` and the whole house erupts.

## Scenarios

Chimes work well with scenarios, you can easily add a chime for all critical notifications without
having to change any of the automations. See [Scenarios](../usage/scenarios.md) and [Recipes](../recipes/index.md)
for more details.
