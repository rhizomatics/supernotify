# Configuration

Start with the simplest possible config, like the [minimal](examples/minimal.md) example. This will allow you to notify using *Notify Entities* and push mobile notifications to all the devices registered in Home Assistant, without specifying any targets, or any other config.

[Deliveries](deliveries.md) explains how to set up the basic notification channels you want, and [Configuration Levels](levels.md) how to choose the best place to put configuration for simplicity, clarity and concision.

If using email attachments,  e.g. from camera snapshot or a `snapshot_url`, some extra config needed, detailed in [Multimedia Basic Configuration](multimedia.md#basic-configuration)
