# Recipe - Content Escalation

## Purpose

Make a notification more impactful if it has certain words in it.

## Implementation

Uses a **Scenario** and ability of standard templating to see and make logic checks
on the notification message.

In this case a Frigate notification of a person detection is usually a medium priority, however
if the alarm state indicates the house is empty, these are sent as text message, email and mobile
push just to make sure it gets through.

## Example Configuration

```yaml
high_alert:
      alias: make a fuss if alarm armed or high priority
      condition:
        condition: and
        conditions:
          - "{{notification_priority not in ['critical','low']}}"
          - condition: or
            conditions:
              - "{{notification_priority in ['high'] and 'person was detected' in notification_message|lower }}"
              - condition: state
                entity_id: alarm_control_panel.home_alarm_control
                state:
                  - armed_away
                  - armed_vacation
      delivery:
        plain_email:
        sms:
        apple_push:
      action_groups:
        - alarm_panel
        - lights
```

## Variations

- Use ```{{'LONE_HOME' in occupancy}}``` to check if home is empty
