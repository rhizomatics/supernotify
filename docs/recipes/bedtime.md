# Recipe - Bedtime

## Purpose

Regardless of where the sun is in the sky, my bed times stay much the same, so
use this in working out how to make notifications, and don't disturb me!

## Implementation

Uses a **Scenario** condition based on time of day. This can then be referred to in the `require_scenarios`
section of the notify action `data`, or in template logic.

## Example Configuration

```yaml
scenarios:
  bedtime:
        condition:
          condition: time
          alias: Usual bedtime
          after: "21:30:00"
          before: "06:30:00"
```

## Variations

- Use date ranges to alter times across the year
- Define the opposite of bedtime, and use that to allow only notifications then
