This also means if you get bored with that doorbell sound, you can quickly change it one place for all automations that use it.</p> <p>A doorbell notification can be sent to multiple devices just by selecting a tune ( see the Example Configuration below for how this can work.)</p> <pre><code>    - action: notify.supernotify\n      data:\n        message: \"\"\n        delivery:\n            chimes:\n                data:\n                    chime_tune: doorbell\n</code></pre> <p>Another good reason is that when using multiple types of device, you can map their different terms to the same logical sound using simple alias names, for example <code>doorbell</code>. Then within notifications, you can ask for a doorbell sound and it will generated by each device in its own way.</p> <p>In this example, a 433Mhz doorbell will go 'ding dong' and Alexa will play a doorbell noise when the <code>chime_tune: doorbell</code> is set on a notification, and if <code>red_alert</code> is set, it will use Alexa and a siren device.</p> Config Snippet<pre><code> chime_aliases:\n    doorbell:\n      alexa_devices:\n        tune: amzn_sfx_doorbell_chime_02\n      switch:\n        target: switch.chime_ding_dong\n    red_alert:\n      alexa_devices: amzn_sfx_scifi_alarm_04\n      siren:\n        tune: emergency\n        volume: 1.0\n        duration: 30\n      rest_command:\n        alias: Use the custom sound on the camera, defined in rest_command section\n        target: rest_command.camera_alarm_tune\n        data:\n          alarm_id: 12\n</code></pre> <p>For Alexa Devices, there's an additional benefit of using the aliases - it will automatically select all the Alexa device IDs ( those ugly 32 character hexadecimal ones ) if device discovery is left on, as is default. For everything else, you need to pass the list of target entity IDs in the notification action call.</p> <p>The formal schema is published as Chime Aliases Definition.
